## Project Objective
As an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule.

1) WHEN I open the planner, THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
2) WHEN I scroll down, THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours.
3) WHEN I view the time blocks for that day, THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
4) WHEN I click into a time block, THEN I can enter an event or task.
5) WHEN I click the save button for that time block, THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage.
6) WHEN I refresh the page, THEN the saved events persist.
